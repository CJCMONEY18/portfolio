# Gateway Solutions
This portfolio has the game Gateway Solutions, that was created by 4 student developers. With that being said, there is one bug you may encounter. If you or an object falls through the world you'll have to restart the level. Sorry if that is an inconvenience. Click on the blue box in the bottom right to be full screen. This is also my first game going public, so please comment with any feedback or issues you may find while playing. I HOPE YOU ENJOY GATEWAY SOLUTIONS!
